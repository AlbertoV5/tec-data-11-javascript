* UFO JS

[[https://albertov5.github.io/tec-data-11-javascript/][The Truth is Out There!]]

** Overview

In this project we had the mission to present data in an accessible and dynamic way. We had a few parameters to use for filtering, and even though the filters are simple, we get the information we want at the press of a key.

We managed to provide a fully functional HTML website with dynamic elements powered by Javacript and the best part is that we get to host it in GitHub and share it with clients and colleagues.

** Results

We have a webpage with information at the top which gives us an introduction to the kind of data we are dealing with.
#+attr_html: :width 700px

If we scroll down, we will find a table will all the available data. Note that we have filters in the left side as highlighted with the red rectangle.

We can filter the table on the right by entering text in the fields on the left. For example, we can look for all UFO with the =shape= of =circle=
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[./resources/part3.png]]

Furthermore, we can make more complex searches by using the other fields. For example, if we wanted all sightings on =1/1/2010= in the =state= of =ca= with the =shape= of =light=, then we can do a query like the following:

#+attr_html: :width 700px

We've managed to present a clear table in a compelling way without a single piece of code from the user.
